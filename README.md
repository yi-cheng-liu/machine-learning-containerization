# Build and Run a Docker Container for Machine Learning Model

## üéØ Goal
The concept involves creating a Docker container for a basic machine learning model in a straightforward and effortless manner. To embark on this, we'll focus on three essential files:

- Dockerfile
- train.py
- inference.py

The `train.py` is a Python script responsible for processing and standardizing EEG data from a CSV file (train.csv), and then training two classification models using scikit-learn. It saves two different models: one based on **Linear Discriminant Analysis** (clf_lda) and another based on a **multi-layer perceptron Neural Network** (clf_NN).

`inference.py` is designed for batch inference. It loads the previously created models and uses them to classify new EEG data, which is normalized and fed from another CSV file (test.csv). The script then proceeds to compute the classification accuracy and predictions, providing an overview of the model's performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build the image and the container

Building the image
```
docker build -t docker-ml-model -f Dockerfile .
```

Perform the inference on new data (test.csv)
```
docker run docker-ml-model python3 inference.py
```
